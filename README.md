#Description
-- This is a cgpa predictor programmed using python. 
   It is a predictor that can be integrated into a web based system.
   In the cgpa_learn.py file, you will train, test and split the csv data then, predict the cgpa for sem 7. The csv contain sem 1 until 6 cgpa datas.
   In the cgpa_predict.py file, you will integrate the .py file with the .php file in the easiest way.
   I hope this can be your reference for your similar projects.
